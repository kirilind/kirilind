It is natural for humans to mystify and mythologize things they do not fully comprehend. Storytelling makes up a great part of our cultures, and enables transferring knowledge in simplified ways. However, in the quest to understand the variety of technologies described as Artificial Intelligence, it is necessary to avoid stereotypes. 

As its artificial counterpart, “intelligence” is a metaphor for a complex set of skills formed by neural structure, experience and memory. We will take a look beyond metaphors and stereotypes to understand the kinds of tasks machines can and cannot do for humans, and how it may shape the future of work.
